# My first attempt at TDD through Django

I have been following along [Obey The Testing Goat](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/). 

During these two weeks going through this book I have learned a lot. From simple things like the basic structure of test driven development, all the way up to deploying a website using sockets. 

To get the site running, it requires python3.6.

Installing a virtualenv, and then calling the requirements.txt to install selenium and django correctly, are the steps to run this project.
